# ResponsivePortfolio

Published site:  https://kenyaallen.github.io/ResponsivePortfolio/

This is my attempt at completing homework assignment two in where I am tasked with utilizing Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. My completed assignment does not make proper use of Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).  There is much review that I am in need of to succesfully execute this technique.


This assignment incorporates the objectives of the student being able to:
*create GitHub repositories, and push up code;
*create html documents;
*properly creating html documents that utilize css and bootstrap concepts which include but are         
 not limited to floating, positioning, typography, pseudo-classes, and media queries. 


The responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer we should be able to create mobile applications that are responsive in design to an existing application.

Directions are to:  Create the following files: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html; while using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items: a navbar, a responsive layout, and 
responsive images
